"""Cross-region avatar build guard.

The avatar worker runs on Cloud Run in ``asia-southeast1`` because that is the
only region where this project holds L4 GPU quota. When a build config pushes
the (multi-GB) worker image to the Seoul Artifact Registry instead, every
Cloud Run cold start pulls it back across regions and the transfer is billed.

``tests/test_avatar_retired_generation_paths.py`` already pins the canonical
root config. This module widens that to *every* tracked Cloud Build config, so
a stale copy cannot reintroduce a Seoul destination for the avatar worker.
